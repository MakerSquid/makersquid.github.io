Hello, this is the webpage for the github user 'MakerSquid'
<p>
There is also a minecraft server out there for people who know HylandQuidClan...
<p>
The server can be found at 142.4.204.26:25592
<p>
The server has a whitelist.  If you can't connect contact Hyland on Discord.
<p>
  Interesting Features:
  <ul>
    <li>set up to 100 homes</li>
    <li>silk spawners</li>
    <li>Seed: -8426942547424202912</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I'm thinking of adding the block elevators and tinker's construct and the tool leveling...  I miss those 3x3 hammers...
    <p>
      EDIT: Well, turns out that with creative and worldedit there isn't much point to adding tinker's...
      <p>
        Message me if you're not an OP.
