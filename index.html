		It's not perfect, there are a few scratches, but it's not embarrasing either.  The pinstripe is coming off a bit.  The black plastic is faded.  The hood paint is slightly off-color from the rest.  No major dents though.  No known mechanical issues.  This is my favorite of the CR-V iterations.  I like the 1st gen too, but I'm not a fan of the way they've become all roundy after this generation.  These little suvs handle bad weather and snow extremely well.  They sometimes run forever, I've seen them with nearly 400k on them.  That was my plan (to use it for ages) but I recently aquired a 2006 model that will replace it.  This would make a great 1st car.  I know: my son has one as his first car, and my daughter has one as her 3rd car.  They're incredibly reliable too, just change the oil and maintain them with a little bit of care and they'll reward you.  I bought this one at an insurance auction, the hood was dented and the condenser and radiator were broken.  The broken parts were replaced and the grill and bumper cover are still the originals.  The last image is of the original hood, you can see the damage was minor.
