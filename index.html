Hello, this is the webpage for the github user 'MakerSquid'
<p>
There is also a minecraft server out there for people who know HylandQuidClan...
<p>
The server can be found at 142.4.204.26:25592
<p>
The server has a whitelist.  If you can't connect contact Hyland on Discord.
<p>
  Interesting Features:
  <ul>
    <li>set up to 100 homes</li>
    <li>silk spawners</li>
    <li>Seed: -8426942547424202912</li>
	<li>world edit</li>
	<li>creative</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I'm thinking of adding the block elevators...
      <p>
        Message me if you're not an OP and think you should be.
